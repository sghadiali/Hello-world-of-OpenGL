# Hello-world-of-OpenGL
This Repo was made by following OpenGL series of The Cherno from youtube and learnopengl.com website. it contains abstractions of various OpenGL Basic APIs like vertex buffers, shaders and camera (using pitch and yaw).
If you want to learn OpenGL, be sure to check those out. You may also want to check out r/OpenGL on reddit.
